<p><b><font size="+2">M</font>ars 4</b> was launched by the USSR on 21 July 1973 and its twin, <b>Mars 5</b>, was launched 4 days later on 25 July. As Mars 4 approached the red planet on 10 February 1974, its retro-engine malfunctioned, placing it into a heliocentric orbit. However, in February 1974, the Mars 5 probe was put successfully into orbit around Mars, with apoapsis 32,560 km, periapsis 1760 km. The inclination of the orbit to the equator of the planet was 35 dgrees;. It took 24 hours 53 minutes to complete one orbit. Both probes contained identical sets of instruments intended to investigate the composition, structure, and properties of the Martian atmosphere and surface.</p>

            <div class="flex-fill">Mars 4 &amp; 5 both contained a 256-channel NaI scintillation gamma-ray spectrometer which was 63 &times; 63 mm, with charged particle rejection. The instrument was located on a boom away from the spacecraft body to reduce background noise. Its primary objective was to measure the spectral composition of Mars&rsquo; gamma-radiation. However, a series of measurements of the cosmic gamma-ray background were made during the flight from Earth to Mars.</div>

<h3>Science Highlights</h3>

<ul class="usa-list usa-list--unstyled">
<li class="padding-bottom-1">A series of measurements of the cosmic gamma-ray background were made during the flight from Earth to Mars. Six measurements sessions were performed at 61.2, 85.4, and 93.8 million miles from Earth. The Mars 4 & 5 gamma-ray spectrometers found an average cosmic gamma-radiation background flux density of 1.85 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> quanta/m<sup>2</sup>/s</li>
<li class="padding-bottom-1">Mars 5 went on to be a great success in its primary studies of Mars, completing 22 orbits of the planet while collecting and transmitting data until 28 Feb 1974, when its transmitter failed.</li>
