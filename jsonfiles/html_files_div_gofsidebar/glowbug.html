<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Glowbug</b> mission was a gamma-ray telescope affixed to the International Space Station (ISS). It was launched on March 14, 2023, and installed on the Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (JEM-EF). It began operations on March 20, and operated through April 2024. The mission was led by the Naval Research Laboratory through the Department of Defense Space Test Program and funded through the NASA Astrophysics Research and Analysis program. Its primary mission was to detect short gamma-ray burst (sGRBs) from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole binary mergers. It was also a providing ground for a proposed future GAMERA SmallSat mission, the StarBurst Multimessenger Pioneers mission, and Glowbug-2 instrument.</p><p>The instrument had a wide field of view and was sensitive to gamma-rays in the 30 keV &ndash; 2 MeV range. The detector consisted of 12 CsI(Tl) detector panels arranged to allow reconstruction of burst location with modest accuracy. There were also a set of six Cs<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6</sub>(Ce) (CLLB) cylindrical detectors to extend sensitive above &sim;1 MeV. Both detectors used silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to detect light from gamma-rays absorbed by the scintillation material. The SiPMs built on a heritage design successfully tested with the Strontium Iodide Radiation Instrumentation missions (SIRI-1 &amp; SIRI-2), as were mission and data acquisition systems. </p><p>The instrument sat on a pedestal to protrude above the ISS mounted on the zenithal side of the station, ideal for observing astronomical gamma-ray sources. However, Glowbug was also able to detect some terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.</p>

            <div class="flex-fill">A suite of 12 CsI(Tl) detectors provide an ultra-wide field of view of the unocculted sky (8 steridian). Each large-area detector panel was a 150 mm &times; 150 mm, 10 mm thick crystal, with a 1 &times; 21 array of 6 mm &times; 6 mm SiPMS used to read out the thin edge of the crystal. The SensL J-series SiPMs were flight-proven on the SIRI-1 mission. The individual detectors were arranged in bi-packs, arranged in pairs along the &plusnm;x and y axis, and with four on the +z (zenith-facing) side. The outward facing side of each panel had a thin aluminum window while the crystal was backed with a steel and tantalum shield which attenuated gamma rays below &sim;300 keV to stop photons entering the rear-facing side. Localization of bursts by maximum likelihood algorithms provided typical localization of &lt;5&deg; (compared to 10&deg; for comparable sGRBs with Fermi GBM) and roughly twice Fermi GBM&rsquo;s effective area with a typical sGRB spectrum. This expanded the horizon for faint objects in the local Universe by &sim;1.4 (and thus encompassed roughly 3 times Fermi GBM&rsquo;s detectable volume of space).</p></div>
