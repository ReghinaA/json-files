It was put into a highly elliptical orbit with apogee 200,000 km, perigee 550 km, and inclination 65 degrees. It carried the first instrument package, SIGNE 1, resulting from the Franco-Soviet SIGNE collaboration. This instrument was intended to perform solar radiation studies. However, it detected cosmic gamma-ray bursts as well as solar events.</p>\n\n<p>Prognoz 2 reentered the atmosphere on 15 December 1982.</p>",
