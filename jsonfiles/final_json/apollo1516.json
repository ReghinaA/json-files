Both released sub-satellites while in orbit around the Moon to do studies on lunar gravity and magnetic fields. Apollo 16 astronauts John Young and Charles Duke deployed a UV electrographic camera/spectrograph on the lunar surface. The instrument observed the Sun, the Earth&rsquo;s geocorona and various astronomical objects. Both Apollo 15 &amp; 16 Command Service Modules carried gamma-ray spectrometers. These spectrometers studied the Moon and the gamma-ray background.</p>",
