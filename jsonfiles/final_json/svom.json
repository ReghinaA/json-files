It is planned for a three year duration mission after its launch on June 22, 2024 from the Xichang launch facility in China aboard a Long March 2C rocket. It was placed into a 625 km altitude low earth orbit with a 30&deg; inclination and a 96 minute orbital period.</p>",

The detector is equipped with processing to trigger on unknown sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, rapidly slewing to bring the narrower-field MXT and VT instruments on source, as well as sending data and alert notices to the ground-based systems for co-observation."

Triangulation with the three detectors can narrow down gamma-ray burst location to a 15&deg; &times; 15&deg; area, sufficient for training other instruments on source. Each GRM will use a NaI crystal for detection with plastic scintillation across the detector front to distinguish gamma-rays from low energy electrons."

The VT focal plane will be equipped with two 2048&times;2048 CCD cameras: one sensitive to blue, the other to red/near infrared: this is anticipated to be sensitive to objects of visual magnitude 22.5 with 300 seconds of observation: the VT thus should be able to see gamma-ray burst optical afterglow out to a redshift of 6.5, corresponding to 12 billion light years. VT is expected to about 60 gamma-ray burst sources a year."
