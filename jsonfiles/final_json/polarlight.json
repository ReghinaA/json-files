It used a gas pixel detector sensitive to polarized X-ray light. The satellite was launched into a sun synchronous polar orbit on October 28, 2018. The mission was led by the China Center for Astrophysics at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.</p>\n\n<p>The satellite reentered the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in early January 2025.",
