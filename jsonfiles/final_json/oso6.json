	"Intended primarily to study bursts and flares from the Sun, the instrument was also used to search for hard X-ray coincidences with known gamma-ray bursts (primarily those seen by the Vela satellites). Three such coincidences were observed. The NRL instrument, when combined with data from the OGO-5 satellite, confirmed 5 hard X-ray bursts (they detected 12 altogether)."
