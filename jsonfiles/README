This directory contains Python code for reading .json files and generating HTML files from a
standard Jinja flask template. There pages from high energy astrophysics mission pages
and Guest Observer Facility (GOF) pages associated with the high energy astrophysics site
heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov. Pages are created in various different draft concept styles and
uploaded to the SED gitlab repository for review and for final design concept selection.

Read the HOWTO file for instructions on using the code.

DIRECTORIES

clean_json/                      Working input directory for .json files 

final_json/                      Storage for all .json files that point to
                                 local (rather than GOF) HTML pages.
				 I.e. /docs/heasarc/missions/(mission_name).html

static_output/                   Directory containing the output from running the code
                                 HTML files are copied to GIT repository and staged
				 and to the relevant html_files_... directory locally

gof_json/                        Storage for all .json files that are on GOF pages
                                 I.e. /docs/(mission_name)/(mission_name).html

gof_json_local/                  Storage for all .json files that are mission pages,
                                 but for which there is also GOF directory which
				 does NOT have a simple mission page summary
				 (e.g. NICER)
				 

datenav/                         Sidebar HTML with decadal navigation features.
                                 Used ONLY by HTML pages with decadal sorting


gof_html/                        Output HTML files to go into GOF directories

html_files_div_gofsidebar/
html_files_div_nosidebar/
html_files_tables_datesidebar/
html_files_tables_gofsidebar/
html_files_tables_localbar/
html_files_tables_nosidebar/
                                 Directories with output HTML with various different
				 test configurations. These include:
				 * Use of a table to break out instrument
				   capabilities
				 * Alternative layout that instead uses
				   div tags (less elegant appearance, but
				   mobile-friendly)
				 * Use of GOF side bar navigation
				   (matches current HEASARC page design)
				 * Use of all mission names side bar navigation
				   sorted by decade AND with the decade of the
				   selection mission "active"
				 * Use of "local" navigation instead of mission
				   or GOF page listing. I.e. links to that mission
				   pages's bibliography, gallery, and/or external
				   sites
				 * Version with no sidebar at all into order to us
				   available screen space more efficiently


templates/                       HTML templates used by code to convert .json into
                                 individual mission pages using standard Flask
				 and Beautiful Soup notation to fill in elements

README                           This file

HOWTO                            Instructions on how to use the code

blank.json                       Empty .json example to show all possible
                                 supported variable. Real .json files may
				 lack of these fields (e.g. no GOF-related
				 setting on non-GOF mission files)

decades.list                     Not used by code
                                 List of all missions broken down by the
				 decade of launch
                           
mission_template.html            Input template used to generate HTML pages

missions.json                    Output .json listing each mission and when processed
                                 Not used by code or processing, but potentially
				 useful in debugging.

CODE

add_decades.pl                   Perl script used to generate the decadal sidebar components

write_html.py                    MASTER PYTHON CODE. See HOWTO to see how to operate
                                 Reads all .json files in clean_json/ and writes all
				 .html files to static_output/ using mission_template.html
				 to direct layout design
