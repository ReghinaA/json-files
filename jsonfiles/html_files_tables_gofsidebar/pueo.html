<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO)</b> mission is a balloon-borne payload which will fly over Antarctica. The balloon gondola will carry an array of radio frequency (RF) receivers, designed to measure RF signals from neutrinos passing through the Antarctic ice sheet. It is based on the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), though PUEO will use much more powerful detectors. PUEO was selected by NASA for funding under the Pioneers Program. and is led by the University of Chicago, with instrument and gondola elements developed and supported by a number of institutions. The initial month-long flight is planned for December 2025 during austral summer for near-continuous daylight and reliable circumpolar wind patterns around Antarctica. The balloon will be launch from McMurdo Station&rsquo;s Long Duration Balloon Facility.</p>

<p>Ultra-high energy neutrinos interact with ice, producing radio emissions through the Askaryan Effect. A stratospheric balloon can observe the entire Antarctic ice sheet providing an exceedingly large detector volume. These measurements are best at the highest energies (&gt;10<sup>18</sup> eV) and complement ground-based detectors such as IceCube which are attuned to lower energy neutrinos. PUEO will also measure extensive air showers (EAS) from ultra-high energy cosmic rays interacting with the upper atmosphere.</p>

<tr><th rowspan="1">Main Instrument</th>
     <td colspan="2">108 dual-polarization quad-ridge horn attennas measuring 300&ndash;1200 MHz radio frequencies, measured across 216 channels, arranged in 5 rings in 24 azimuthal sectors: the top four rings are canted 10&deg; downward from the horizon, while the final lowest ring is canted downward at 40&deg; to improve sensitivity to EAS events. Electronics onboard will performed phased array interferometry to improve signal to noise ratios and for better rejection of anthropogenic interference (typically from well-defined localized sources): masking of affected antennas will also improve detector performance.</td>
</tr>
  <tr><th rowspan="1">Low Frequency Instrument</th>
     <td colspan="2">A suite of 4 dual-polarized attennas (additional LF horns may be added) which dangle below the gondola. These collect data in an 8-channel band. This dedicated system will improve overall sensitivity to cosmic rays and tau lepton decays: data collected will also inform possible future instruments targeting tau lepton events specifically.</td>

  <tr><th rowspan="1">Supporting Electronics and Hardware</th>
     <td colspan="2">The Main and Low Frequency Instruments are connected to onboard processing systems via Radio Frequency over Fibre to support the 224-channel spectral data collection, digitalized and processed onboard, and stored for collection in hard drives built specifically to operate in the very cold high altitude environment and to survive flight-related stress (including hard landing).<br> The gondola is based on the ANITA flights and is designed to be both strong and lightweight to meet long-duration balloon requirements.</td>
