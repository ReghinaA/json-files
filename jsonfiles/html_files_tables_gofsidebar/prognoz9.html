<p><bb><font size="+2">P</font>rognoz 9</b> was launched 1 July 1983 into a highly eccentric orbit (apogee 720,000 km; perigee 380 km). The orbital inclination was 65.5 degrees and the orbital period was 26.7 days. The spacecraft was spin stabilized with a period of 113 s. The spin axis pointed towards the Sun, and was repointed every few days.</p>

<tr><td colspan="2">The SIGNE II M P-9 experiment was designed to study cosmic and solar gamma-ray bursts. The experiment included 2 identical 15 cm diameter by 2 cm thick NaI (Tl) scintillators. One faced in the solar direction, and the other faced the anti-solar direction. Thus, 4-pi steradians were under simultaneous observation. These detectors were some 3 times larger than the previously flown SIGNE detectors.</p>

<p>The output pulses from each photomultiplier were analyzed simultaneously in 11 energy channels. Background counts were accumulated over 64 s intervals. A trigger signal was generated for the solar-pointed detector when the count rate exceeded the background by 8-sigma over a 0.5 s interval. For the anti-solar detector, a trigger signal was generated when the count rate in either a 0.5 s or a 2 s interval exceeded the background by 8-sigma. This led to a trigger threshold of &sim;3 &times; 10<sup>-7</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s for a gamma-ray burst spectrum of E<sup>-2</sup>. Typically, data were integrated in 164 s bins, 11 energy channels when not triggered. Once a burst trigger occurred, data could be taken in 1/64 s bins, 4&ndash;7 energy channels. The total allocated bit rate was 6 b/s.</td></tr>

<h3>Science Highlights</h3>

<p>Data from Prognoz 9 confirmed the existence of soft, repeating sources (along with ISEE-3 and PVO). Prognoz 9 also discovered an extremely intense burst (fluence 10<sup>-3</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>) on 1 August 1983. The energy spectrum was observed up to over 8 MeV, with rapid variability in the high energy spectra.</p>
