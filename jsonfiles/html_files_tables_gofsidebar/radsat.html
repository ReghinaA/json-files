<p><font size="+2">T</font>he pin stabilized satellite <b>Radsat</b> was launched by the US Air Force on 2 October 1972 into a noon-midnight, Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite is sometimes referred to as 1972-076B (its international launch number) or P72-1. The inclination was 98.4 degrees; the apogee and perigee were 761 and 736 km, respectively. The cylindrical spacecraft was 2.13 m long and 1.37 m in diameter. Antenna booms extended 2.74 m from each end, coincident with the spin axis. The orbital period was 99.5 minutes, and the spin period was 5 s. The satellite carried 5 instruments: a gamma-ray spectrometer, an extreme ultraviolet detector, 2 low-altitude particle detectors, and a thermocontrol coating test instrument. The gamma-ray instrument ceased function after ~7 months.

<tr><td colspan="2">The gamma-ray detector was a 50 cm<sup>3</sup> Ge(Li) spectrometer cooled by solid CO<sub>2</sub>. The detector was surrounded by a W collimator and a stainless steel tungsten rear shield, which was in turn surrounded by a 4&pi; anti-coincidence plastic scintillator. The detector covered the energy range 40 keV &ndash; 2.8 MeV, with 4096 channels. The maximum resolution was &sim;4 keV (FWHM) at all energies. However, this resolution was short-lived, and during most of the lifetime of the experiment the resolution was between 10&ndash;50 keV. Data were accumulated in 1 ms time bins during a burst.</p>

<h3>Science Highlights</h3>

<p>Several gamma-ray bursts which were also seen by the Vela satellites were seen by Radsat. A &sim;60-ms microburst was seen prior to the Vela trigger time for the 18 December 1972 event. Furthermore, the spectrum was seen to soften in this event at later times.</p>
