It was the second of NASA&rsquo;s three HEAO mission. The few arcsecond angular resolution, the field-of-view of tens of arcminutes, and a sensitivity several 100 times greater than any mission before it provided, for the first time, the capability to image extended objects, diffuse emission, and to detect faint sources. It was also the first X-ray NASA mission to have a Guest Observer program.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it was A key mission in X-ray astronomy and its scientific outcome completely changed the view of the X-ray sky.</p>",

It was slightly de-focused so that a point source was blurred to a radius of &sim;1&prime;. There was 128 energy channel resolution, with each channel being about 45 eV wide. A time-dependent build-up of ice (water) on the detector surface occurred because of cryopumping of ambient outgassing material onto the 100 K detector. It was periodically defrosted by heating to 220 K at the beginning of a series of three days of observations. Each defrost reduced the total amount of ice that returned, such that after 9 months the ice covering was almost gone. A model had been developed that predicted the ice parameter as a function of time, and was used to obtain the correct response matrix for any given observation. The cryogen keeping the SSS at its operational temperature of 100 K ran out, as expected, in October 1979, between Day 276 (Oct 3) and Day 286 (Oct 13)."

Each photon detected by the MPC was pulse-height analyzed into one of 8 bins, the size of which increased logarithmically with energy from 0.41 keV, for the lowest energy bin, to 6.72 keV for the highest energy bin.  The MPC obtained useful data from 1978 November 19 until 1981 April 17, with the exception of a 3-month period from 27 Aug 1980 to 8 Dec 1980 when operation was intermittent, due to Einstein Observatory attitude control problems"
