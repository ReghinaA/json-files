The detectors for observing cosmic X-ray sources were the X-ray proportional counters, built by MIT, the hard X-ray telescope by UC San Diego and the Gamma Ray Monitor by the University of New Hampshire.</p>",

The detection system consisted of two banks of proportional counters which viewed the sky through tubular collimators in five broad energy intervals (1&ndash;1.5 keV; 1&ndash;6 keV; 3&ndash;10 keV; 15&ndash;40 keV; 30&ndash;60 keV). The data were recorded in 256 azimuthal bins as the detector scanned across a small circle on the sky with each spin."

The instrument was in the wheel section of OSO-7. The monitor operated until 25 December 1972, but was usually turned off during the periodic penetration of the satellite into the radiation belts."
