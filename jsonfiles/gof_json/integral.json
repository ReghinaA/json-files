    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL)</b> of the European Space Agency was successfully launched on October 17, 2002. It was lifted off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan on a Russian Proton launcher and placed in a 72-hour elliptical orbit, ranging from 9,000 km up to 155,000 km from Earth. INTEGRAL is the successor of the ESA gamma-ray observatory Cos-B and the NASA gamma-ray Observatory CGRO. It produced a complete map of the sky in the soft gamma-ray waveband and it is capable of performing high spectral and spatial observations in gamma rays. The observatory was also equipped with X-ray and optical detectors to provide simultaneous observations in these wavebands.</p>",
