XMM-Newton is ESA&rsuoq;s second cornerstone of the Horizon 2000 Science Programme. It carries high thoughput X-ray telescopes with an unprecedented effective area, and an optical monitor, the first flown on a X-ray observatory. The large collecting area and ability to make long uninterrupted exposures provide highly sensitive observations.</p>",
