Astro-E was developed at the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in collaboration with the US and Japanese institutions. Astro-E was to carry, among other instruments, a new type of X-ray spectrometer, the X-ray micro-calorimenter, which would have provided an unprecendent energy resolution compared to non-dispersive instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The mission was rebuild as ASTRO-E2, renamed Suzaku, that was successfully launched in 2005 and operated for 10 years.</p>",
