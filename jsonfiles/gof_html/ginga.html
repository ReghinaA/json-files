<p><b><font size="+2">A</font>stro-C, renamed Ginga</b> (Japanese for 'galaxy'), was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center on 5 February 1987. The primary instrument for observations was the Large Area Counter (LAC). Ginga was the third Japanese X-ray astronomy mission, following Hakucho and Tenma. Ginga reentered the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere on 1 November 1991

        The field of view was arranged with the longer side parallel to the spacecraft Z-axis, and was defined by honeycomb collimators made of thin stainless steel sheets. The counters were filled with a gas mixture of 70 percent argon, 25 percent xenon, and 5 percent carbon dioxide to a total pressure of 2 atmospheres at 20 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Accepted X-ray events were pulse-height analysed into a maximum of 48 pulse height channels. The time resolution was mode-dependent. The highest time resolution available was 0.98 milliseconds, achieved at the expense of spectral information. The detection limit for the LAC was approximately 0.1 milliCrab, or 2 &times; 10<sup>-12</sup> ergs/cm2-sec in the range 2&ndash;10 keV.

        The All-Sky Monitor (ASM) consisted of 2 identical gas proportional counter. Each counter was equipped with a collimator which had 3 different fields of view. The aim of the ASM was to create an all-sky survey every 1-2 days to look for transient events (to alert the LAC) and to collect a long-term record for X-ray sources.

        The purpose of the Gamma-Ray Burst Detector (GBD) was to detect gamma-ray bursts with high-energy resolution. It was comprised of two sensors: a proportional counter (PC) and a scintillation spectrometer (SC). The GBD could also operate as a radiation belt monitor for high particle backgrounds which could harm the other 2 experiments.
