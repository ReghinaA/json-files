<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he European Space Agency&rsquo;s X-ray Observatory, EXOSAT</b>, was operational from May 1983 to April 1986. During that time, EXOSAT made 1780 observations of a wide variety of objects, including active galactic nuclei, stellar coronae, cataclysmic variables, white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, clusters of galaxies, and supernova remnants.</p>

<p>EXOSAT was launched on 1983 May 26 from the Vandenberg complex in the USA on a Thor-Delta rocket and put in a highly eccentric orbit (e &sim;0.93) with a 90.6 hr period and an inclination of 73 degrees. The mission lifetime was ultimately limited by orbital decay, which was projected to occur within 3 yr. The spacecraft performed within specifications for almost three years. On 1986 April 9 a failure in the attitude control system caused the loss of the spacecraft. The natural decay of the orbit caused EXOSAT to re-enter on 1986 May 6.

        90 hour highly-eccentric Earth orbit. The science instruments were operated above 50,000 km, outside the earth&rsquo;s radiation belts. This allowed scientific operations for up to 76 hr per 90 hr orbit, without interruption. EXOSAT was visible from the ground station at Villafranca in Spain for almost the entire time that the science instruments were operated and there was no need for any onboard data storage.

        The Medium Energy (ME) instrument consisted of an array of eight proportional counter. Each proportional counter had two gas chambers separated by a 1.5 mm beryllium window with argon in the top layer and xenon in the lower. Each proportional counter used a multi-wire design with a deltaE/E of 21(E/6 keV)-0.5 % FWHM for the argon chambers and 18(E/22 keV)-0.5 % FWHM for the xenon chambers. The argon and xenon spectra were pulse height analysed into 128 channels each, sensitive to 1-20 keV and 5-50 keV energy range respectively.
