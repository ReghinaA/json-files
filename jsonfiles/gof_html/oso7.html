<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Seventh Orbiting Solar Observator (OSO 7)</b> like the other Orbiting Solar Observatory missions, was primarily a solar observatory designed to point a battery of UV and X-ray telescopes at the Sun from a platform mounted on a cylindrical wheel. The detectors for observing cosmic X-ray sources were the X-ray proportional counters, built by MIT, the hard X-ray telescope by UC San Diego and the Gamma Ray Monitor by the University of New Hampshire.</p>

        The proportional counters and hard X-ray telescope on board OSO-7 scanned the entire sky and obtained good exposure of point sources through repeated scans. Data from the proportional counters yielded a &ldquo;multi-color&rdquo; catalog of 184 sources (Markert et al., 1979) and the detection from Centaurus A of rapid intensity variability (Winkler &amp; White, 1975). The X-ray telescope studied the high energy temporal and spectral behavior of a number of sources including Her X-1 (Ulmer er al., 1973) and Vela X-1 (Ulmer et al., 1972).

        Just under three years of data on celestial X-ray sources were obtained using the MIT instrument. The detection system consisted of two banks of proportional counters which viewed the sky through tubular collimators in five broad energy intervals (1&ndash;1.5 keV; 1&ndash;6 keV; 3&ndash;10 keV; 15&ndash;40 keV; 30&ndash;60 keV). The data were recorded in 256 azimuthal bins as the detector scanned across a small circle on the sky with each spin.

        The UCSD OSO-7 X-ray telescope was designed to detect X-rays in the range from about 7 to 550 keV. It consisted of a 1 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal inside a massive CsI(Na) anticoincidence shield. The total detector weight was 85 lbs.

        The UNH gamma-ray monitor consisted of a 7.6 cm x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) scintillator. The detector was surrounded on all sides by a &sim;4 cm thick CsI(Na) scintillator cup. The exception was a forward aperture which was covered by a 0.5 cm thick CsI(Na) slab. The instrument was calibrated regularly each orbit with a <sup>60</sup>Co source. The instrument was in the wheel section of OSO-7. The monitor operated until 25 December 1972, but was usually turned off during the periodic penetration of the satellite into the radiation belts.
