<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he HEAO-3</b> satellite carried three high-energy-astrophysics instruments, one instrument surveying the sky in hard X-rays and gamma rays, and two measuring the composition of cosmic rays.  The High Resolution Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Experiment built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was the largest germanium spectrometer placed in orbit at that time.  The cosmic-ray instruments, one built by a Danish-French collaboration and the other built as a collaboration among Washington University in St. Louis, Caltech, and University of Minnesota were the largest cosmic-ray detectors to have flown in space.</p>

<p>HEAO-3, like HEAO-1, was a survey mission involving several independent but complementary instruments. This satellite was launched by NASA on September 20, 1979 into an orbit of 500 km altitude, 43.6 degrees inclination. The mission included two cosmic ray experiments, the Heavy Nuclei Experiment, the Cosmic Ray Isotope Experiment, and the Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy Experiment.</p>

        The Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Experiment on HEAO-3 consisted of four p-type, high purity germanium detectors, each with a volume of &sim;100 cm<sup>3</sup>. The detectors were surrounded by a large CsI shield in electronic anti-coincidence, which was segmented in order to provide crude directionality. The instrument, under favorable background conditions, could independently detect bursts with fluences as low as 2 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup> above the lower energy limit. For unfavorable background conditions, the lower limit might be 5&ndash;10 times higher than this.
