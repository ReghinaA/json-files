<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Roentgen Satellite, ROSAT</b>, a Germany/US/UK collaboration, was launched on June 1, 1990 and operated for almost 9 years. The first 6 months of the mission were dedicated to the all sky-survey (using the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter detector), followed by the pointed phase. The survey obtained by ROSAT was the first X-ray and XUV all-sky survey using an imaging telescope with an X-ray sensitivity of about a factor of 1000 better than that of UHURU. During the pointed phase ROSAT made deep observations of a wide variety of objects.</p>

        The PSPCs are multiwire proportional counters developed by MPE. The two redundant Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC-B and PSPC-C) were mounted on a carousel within the focal plane turret of the ROSAT XRT. Two flight-spare detectors (PSPC-A and PSPC-D) were also constructed and used for some of the ground calibration measurements. PSPC-C was to be the primary detector for the mission and was used for the PVC phase and the bulk of the All-Sky Survey until it was damaged during the &ldquo;Solar slew&rdquo; following an AMCS glitch on 25 Jan 1991. The reserved PSPC-B detector was used thereafter (and hence during all AO pointed observations except those performed during the PVC phase).

        The Wide Field Camera (WFC) was an EUV telescope designed and built by the United Kingdom. The WFC had its own 0.525 m focal-length mirror assembly consisting of 3 nested Wolter-Schwarzschild mirrors (co-aligned with the XRT). The focal plane instrumentation consisted of a curved microchannel plate (MCP) and a carousel containing 8 filters, of which 6 are science filters.  Use of the various filters allows crude spectral resolution.
