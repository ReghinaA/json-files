<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Mikhailo Lomonosov 300 (MVL-300)</b> mission was a Russian high-energy astrophysics satellite. It was named to honor the 300th anniversary of the birth of the Russian polymath Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov. It was designed by the M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU; itself named after the same intellectual). The mission&rsquo;s purpose was the study gamma-ray bursts at multiple wavelengths, and study transient phenomena in the Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere.</p>

<p>The mission was launched on April 28, 2016 from the Russian Vostochny (Eastern) spacedrome into a polar sun-synchronous orbit aboard the Soyuz 2-1a Volga rocket. The spacecraft bus was based on the mission-proven Kanopus platform. Lomonosov originally had a three year planned lifespan, but roughly ten months shy of that milestone, the data transmission system failed and specialists from MGU and VNIIEM Corporation (the satellite builder) were unable to restore operations.</p>

<h3>Science Highlights</h3>

<p>The Lomonosov mission studied cosmic rays at extremely high energies (10<sup>19</sup> &ndash; 10<sup>20</sup> eV) in search of the predicted GZK spectral cutoff, detected and studied gamma-ray burst sources, as well as upper atmospheric energetic events, including local weather-induced events (e.g. sprites from active thunderstorms), magnetospheric events, and air shower events from cosmic rays striking the Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere.</p>
