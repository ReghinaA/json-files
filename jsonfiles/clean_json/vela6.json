Department of Defense and the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, managed by the U. S. Air Force. The twin spacecraft, Vela 6A and 6B, were launched on 8 April 1970 and placed &sim;180 degrees apart in nearly circular orbits at a geocentric distance of ~118,000 km. The orbital period was &sim;112 hours. Each satellite rotated about its spin axis with a &sim;64-sec period. The satellites carried both X-ray and gamma-ray detectors which could be used for cosmic observations. The X-ray detector was located &sim;90 degrees from the spin axis, and so covered the entire celestial sphere twice per satellite orbit.</p>",

Electronic thresholds provided two energy channels, 3&ndash;12 keV and 6&ndash;12 keV. In front of each crystal was a slat collimator to define the field of view. Sensitivity to celestial sources was severely limited by the high intrinsic detector background."

	"Data from the Vela 6 satellites was used to look for correlations between gamma-ray bursts and X-ray events. At least 2 good candidates were found, GB720514 and GB740723 (<a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982ApJ...254..279T/abstract\">Terrell <i>et al.</i> 1982</a>). The four Vela satellites (5A &amp; B, 6A &amp; B) recorded 73 gamma-ray bursts in the ten year interval July 1969&ndash;April 1979."
