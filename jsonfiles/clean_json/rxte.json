    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, RXTE</b>, was launched on December 30, 1995. RXTE was designed to facilitate the study of time variability in the emission of X-ray sources with moderate spectral resolution. Time scales from microseconds to months are covered in a broad spectral range from 2 to 250 keV. It was designed for a required lifetime of two years, but operated for more than 16 years before being decommissioned.</p>",
