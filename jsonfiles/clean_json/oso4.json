    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he Fourth Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 4)</b> was launched on 18 October 1967. The objectives of the OSO-4 satellite were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere and to measure the direction and intensity over the entire celestial sphere in UV, X, and gamma radiation. The OSO 4 platform consisted of a sail section (which pointed 2 instruments continuously toward the Sun) and a wheel section which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail (which contained 7 experiments). The spacecraft performed normally until a second tape recorded failed in May 1968. OSO-4 was put into a &ldquo;standby&rdquo; mode in November 1969. It could be turned on only for recording special events in real-time. One such event occurred on March 7, 1970 during a solar eclipse. The spacecraft became totally inoperable on 7 December 1971.",
