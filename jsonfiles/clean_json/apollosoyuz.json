    "highlights": [
	"Results from this experiment included the discovery of soft X-ray emission from the supernova remnant MSH 14-63 and of rapid pulsations (0.716 s) from the binary SMC X-1. Due to the (comparatively) short duration of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, little other science of note was done with the proportional counter system. In addition, the detector had a moderately high background level that steadily increased through the duration of the mission until almost no X-ray sources were discernible. The cause of the background problems remains unknown."
