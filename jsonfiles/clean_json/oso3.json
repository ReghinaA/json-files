    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he Third Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-3)</b>, was launched on 8 March 1967, into a nearly circular orbit of mean altitude 550 km, inclined at 33 degrees with respect to the equatorial plane. The satellite had two principle components, a continuously spinning wheel in which the hard X-ray experiment is mounted with a radial view, and a sail component which was served to acquire the sun during the orbit day. The attitude control system maintained the scan plane orientation to within a few degrees of the sun. The spin-period of the satellite of roughly 1.7 s allowed about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/s exposure per revolution to sources on the scan plane. Celestial sources near the ecliptic plane such as Sco X-1 transited the instrument scan plane twice a year. Only real-time data were received from the satellite after the last tape recorder failure on 27 June 1968. The last data transmission occurred 10 November 1969. OSO-3 descended into the atmosphere on 4 April 1982.</p>",

The multi-layer scintillation detector consisted of layers of CsI and plastic. The directional Cerenkov counter was a 3 &times; 3 in cylinder of lucite. The energy detector contained several layers of NaI, sandwiched by layers of tungsten. The entire detector was enclosed by plastic scintillator detectors."

    "highlights": [
	"The instrument flown on OSO-3 obtained extensive observations of solar flares, the diffuse component of cosmic X-rays, and the observation of a single flare episode from Sco X-1.",
	"The gamma-ray instrument registered 621 events attributed to cosmic gamma rays above 50 MeV. A complete sky survey showed that the celestial distribution of gamma rays is highly anisotropic, being concentrated along the galactic equator. In addition, an extended region around the galactic center showed a higher measured intensity."
