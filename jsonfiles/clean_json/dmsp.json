They have launched a series of spacecraft to investigate the Earth&rsquo;s environment from an altitude of &sim;800 km. They were all put into Sun-synchronous near-polar orbits (inclination &sim;99&deg;). The missions of interest to the high-energy science community are DMSPs 8&ndash;15.</p>",

Passing through the outer Van Allen belts 4 times each orbit, and often through the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to a very high background. However, there were still long periods in each orbit during which cosmic gamma-rays could be detected."
