    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he Aryabhata</b> satellite was India&rsquo;s first, named after an ancient Indian mathematician (5th century AD). It was launched on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar. The 96.3 minute orbit had an apogee of 619 km and a perigee of 563 km, at an inclination of 50.7 degrees. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polygon 1.4 m in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar cells. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit. All signals from the spacecraft were lost after 5 days of operation. The satellite reentered the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere on 11 February 1992.",
