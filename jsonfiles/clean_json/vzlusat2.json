    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he VZLUSAT-2</b> mission is a 3U Cubesat proof-of-concept mission for multiple instruments and supporting subsystems including two small gamma-ray burst detectors which are follow-ons from <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"grbalpha.html\">GRBAlpha</a>. It was launched on January 13, 2022 on a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket from Cape Canaveral into a sun-synchronous low earth orbit at an altitude of 550 km. The primary instrument is an Earth observation camera, but secondary instruments include the Gamma Ray Burst Detectors, solar X-ray monitor, and radiation dosimeter, and much of the instrumentation other than the burst detectors are follow-on testbeds from the earlier VZLUSAT-1. VZLUSAT-2 is Czech-led mission with partnerships including the Czech Technical University, the University of West Bohemia, Masaryk University, and the Konkoly Observatory in Hungary, and funded through the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. The spacecraft bus and solar panels were provided by Spacemaniac.</p>\n\n<p>VZLUSAT-2 carries two small gamma-ray burst detectors similar to GRBAlpha, but with modifications to the mounting as required to conform to 3U cube configuration and providing opposing side fields-of-view. The bulk of the 3U satellite package is devoted to other instruments and sub-systems, with a total satellite mass of roughly 3.9 kg.</p>",
