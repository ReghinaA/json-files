They were not intended primarily for astronomical studies but did provide much useful celestial data. The Vela-5A and 5B satellites were launched in 1969 and Vela-6A and 6B in 1970 and they operated in spinning mode. Each operated for about a year except Vela-5B which provided data until mid 1979",
