The combination of high resolution, large collecting area, and sensitivity to higher energy X-rays allows Chandra to study extremely faint sources, sometimes strongly absorbed, in crowded fields. Chandra was boosted into an elliptical high-earth orbit that allows long-duration uninterrupted exposures of celestial objects.</p>",
