The first of these missions, <b>HEAO-1</b> surveyed the X-ray sky almost three times over the 0.2 keV &ndash; 10 MeV energy band, provided nearly constant monitoring of X-ray sources near the ecliptic poles. More detailed studies of a number of objects were made through pointed observations lasting typically 3-6 hours.</p>",

Six of these modules were mounted on the -Y side of the spacecraft, the seventh on the +Y side. The Z-axis of the spacecraft pointed toward the Sun so the viewing directions of the seven A-1 detectors were roughly perpendicular to the solar direction. The experiment had sufficient sensitivity to detect sources as faint as 0.25 &micro;Jy at 5 keV for sources with a Crab-like spectrum. Data was collected in either a 5 or a 320 millisecond timing resolution mode: Full sky coverage for both time resolutions was achieved before the mission&rsquo;s end."

Two of the detectors, designated LEDs (Low Energy Detectors), were thin-window propane filled proportional counters. There was one MED (Medium Energy Detector) which consisted of an argon filled counter. Finally, there were 3 HEDs (High Energy Detectors), which were xenon filled counters. The HEDs and the MED had various collimators which were oriented so that the 3&deg; angular response was always perpendicular to the scan plane. Thus, each rotation of the satellite scanned a great circle 3 degrees wide on the sky passing through the ecliptic poles"

The angular response of the collimators is a series of transmission bands separated by 8 times the FWHM of each band. In this case the bands are 30&Prime; and 2&prime; FWHM, separated by 4&prime; and 16&prime;, respectively for the individual collimators. Each collimator measures position in one dimension, perpendicular to its transmission bands. The X-rays were detected by four sealed proportional counters placed behind each collimator. The 30&prime; collimator (MC1) had a net effective area of 400 cm<sup>2</sup> maximum. One of the MC2 counters failed 2 weeks after launch giving it a net area of 300 cm<sup>2</sup>. The expected sensitivity of &sim;1 Uhuru count/s after two all-sky scans was sufficient to detect any of the then-known 1&ndash;10 keV sources."
