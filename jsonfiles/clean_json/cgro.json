    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO)</b> was launched on April 5, 1991. The second of NASA&rsquo;s great observatories, CGRO has four instruments that cover an unprecedented six orders of magnitude in energy, from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Over this energy range CGRO has an improved sensitivity over previous missions of a full order of magnitude. It operated for almost 9 years and the mission ended on June 4 2000. Unlikely most satellites, CGRO was too large to burn up entirely in the atmosphere during re-entry. To ensure safety on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, NASA redirected the spacecraft into Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere with a controlled re-entry.</p>\n\n<p>The Observatory was named in honor of Dr. Arthur Holly Compton, who won the Nobel prize in physics for work on scattering of high-energy photons by electrons &mdash; a process which is central to the gamma-ray detection techniques of all four instruments.</p>",

Each BATSE detector module contained a Large Area Detector (LAD) which was made of a 50.8 cm diameter &times; 1.27 cm thick NaI(Tl) disk, and a Spectrocscopy Detector (SD) with a smaller NaI crystal with CsI backing for higher spectral resolution and extended energy range. Each individual detector would see roughly 2&pi; sterdians. Relative count rate differences between detectors was used to triangulate on sources."

The phoswich configuration let the electronics discriminate events in the front crystal (gamma rays) from background or charged-particle events interacting in the rear crystal by pulse-shape differences."

It was a two layer Compton telescope in which the upper detector layer made of a 7&times7 array of &sim;28 cm deep liquid scintillator modules, and the lower layer consisted of a 14&times;14 array of &sim;7.5 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystals space about 1.5 m apart from the upper layer. An incident gamma ray would Compton scatter off an electron in the upper layer, and recording the energy of the electron and less energetic scattered photon allowed reconstruction of the original gamma ray energy and the cosine of its incident angle. Multiple events from the same source allowed direction to be determined by the overlap of each of the cosine-defined cones."

Interleaved wire spark-chamber planes measured track direction (with time-of-flight discrimation to select only downward travelling events), and absorbed by a NaI(Tl) total absorption calorimeter to measure their combined energy.
