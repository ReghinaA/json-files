    "descript": "<p><b><font=\"+2\">S</font>IGNE 3</b> was a small French-built satellite (also known as Gamma D2B and Sneg-3) which was originally intended to be launched by the French Diamant rocket, but was actually launched by the Soviets when the Diamant program terminated. Gamma-ray burst detectors have been carried by elements of the Franco-Soviet SIGNE program. SIGNE 1 was a package of experiments flown on the Prognoz 2 satellite; SIGNE 2 was aboard the Prognoz 6. Other SIGNE packages were carried aboard Prognoz 7, Prognoz 9, Venera 11, and Venera 12.</p>\n\n<p>SIGNE 3 was launched on 17 June 1977. It weighed just 103 kg. It was put into an orbit with apogee 519 km, perigee 459 km, and inclination 50.66 degrees. The orbital period was 94.4 minutes. The spin stabilized satellite was a cylinder 0.7 m in diameter and 0.8 m high, with 4 attached solar panels. Attitude control was provided by cold gas jets. The satellite reentered the atmosphere on 22 June 1979.</p>",
