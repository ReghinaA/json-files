The Long March-2D rocket carrying DAMPE to orbit was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. At the start of operations, the mission was planned to have a three year service lifetime, but that was extended for a further two years in December 2018.</p>",

	"DAMPE observes the direction, charge, and energy of electrons and high-energy photons which would be generated when Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs, one of the candidate dark matter particles) annihilate: previous observations by other instruments have suggested this is a likely candidate for dark matter."

The PSD detects the charge of cosmic rays and also serves as an anti-coincidence detector for energetic photons. It has a position resolution of 6 mm and charge resolution of 0.25 for Z = 1&ndash;20. It also serves as a backup to the STK element."

STK tracks the direction of gamma-rays by their conversion to charged particles in the tungsten plates, then tracking the particles through the instrument. STK has 6 tracking planes, each with two layers in X and Y planes, orthogonal to the instrument pointing. Cumulatively, this makes a sensor with 0.2&deg; angular resolution at 10 GeV and the total silicon area is roughly 7 m<sup>2</sup>."

A 0.5 mm gap around each crystal is filled with a silicone elastomer to hold each crystal in place and to prevent damage from launch vibrations. Incident particles interact with the crystals, generating a pulse of optical light which is detected by photomultipliers and each layer edge. The calorimeter is sensitive to energies between 5 GeV to 10 TeV."

Each detector is equipped with a photomultiplier tube to measure light flashes causes by incident neutral particles exciting the boron and generating alpha particles and gamma-rays. The gamma-rays are converted to light pulses recorded by the instrument."
