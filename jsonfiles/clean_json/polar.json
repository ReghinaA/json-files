    "descript": "<p><b><font size=\"+2\">T</font>he POLAR instrument</b> was a gamma-ray burst polarimeter on China&rsquo;s Tiangong 2 space lab. While the highlight of Tiangong 2 was the manned flight mission to the space station, a number of instruments worked over a three year span working autonomously, including POLAR. The space station was deliberately de-orbited in a controlled re-entry in July 2019; the POLAR instrument, however, had ceased functioning due to a power failure on 1 April 2017. The instrument had recorded some 55 bursts and obtained high-precision polarization measurements for five of these burst events.<p>\n\n<p>POLAR should not be confused with GGS Polar, a near-Earth space environment study satellite which operated between 1996 and 2008.</p>",
