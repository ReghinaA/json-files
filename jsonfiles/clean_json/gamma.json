The satellite was in an orbit of &sim;375 km altitude, 51.6 degrees inclination. Gamma offered the possibility of locating COS-B sources with a precision of a few arcminutes. The mission lasted &sim;2 years. The observatory&rsquo;s orbit decayed over time and the satellite re-entered the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in February 1992.",

	"The science instrumentation included the Gamma-1 telescope (with a Telezvezda star tracker), the Disk-M telescope, and the Pulsar X-2 telescope. All 3 instruments were mounted coaxially on the observatory, allowing for simultaneous observation of any given region of the celestial sphere."

It also included a late-mission-planning addition of a tungsten coded aperture mask which could be moved in and out of the field of view. The mask itself was made of 2 1-D masks each having a unit cell size of 1 mm. The basic resolution achieved by the mask was &sim;20&prime; for the weakest sources (4 &sigma;). Shortly after launch, the power to the spark chamber failed. This resulted in the angular resolution for most of the mission being only &sim;10&deg;. The telescope was a joint Soviet-French endeavor."
