Launched on 21 February 1979, it was renamed <b>Hakucho</b> (Japanese for &ldquo;swan&rdquo;) symbolizing one of the most interesting X-ray objects, Cyg X-1. As many other X-ray satellite launched in that period, Hakucho was designed to study and monitor transient phenomena with particular emphasis on X-ray bursts. It was still operating when the second X-ray Japanese satellite Tenma launched in 1983.",
