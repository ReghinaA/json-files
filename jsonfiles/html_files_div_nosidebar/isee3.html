<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE)</b> program consisted of 3 satellites &mdash; ISEE-1 and ISEE-3 were the principal US contribution to the International Magnetospheric Study, and ISEE-2 which was built and managed by ESA. ISEE-1 and -2 were launched on 22 October 1977 into almost coincident orbits. The orbital period was 57 hours, and their separation in the orbit was controlled by maneuvering ISEE-2. ISEE-3 was launched on 12 August 1978. It was inserted into a &ldquo;halo&rdquo; orbit about the libration point some 240 Earth radii upstream between the Earth and Sun. ISEE-3 was renamed ICE (International Cometary Explorer) when, after completing its original mission in 1982, it was gravitationally maneuvered to intercept the comet P/Giacobini-Zinner. On September 11, 1985, the veteran NASA spacecraft flew through the tail of the comet.</p>

<p>NASA formally discontinued operations in May 1997, with no more than a carrier signal left active for tracking. In 2014, ISEE&rsquo;s orbit again brought it near the Earth-Moon system and the &ldquo;ISEE-3 Reboot Project&rdquo; successfully re-established two-way communication. An initial thruster firing on July 2, 2014 was successful (after 27 years in statis), but a longer duration burn on July 8 did not succeed, likely due to depletion of the nitrogen pressurant in the fuel system. Further attempts to command the spacecraft failed, with all contact lost in September 2014.</p>

            <div class="flex-fill">The X-ray spectrometer was designed to study both solar flares and cosmic gamma-ray bursts. The detector was intended to be a part of a long baseline interferometry network of widely separated spacecraft. The efforts were aimed primarily at determining the origin of the bursts through precise directional information established by such a network. The experiment consisted of 2 cylindrical X-ray detectors: a Xenon filled proportional counter covering 5&ndash;14 keV, and a NaI(Tl) scintillator covering 12&ndash;1250 keV. The proportional counter was 1.27 cm in diameter and was filled with a mixture of 97% Xenon and 3% carbon dioxide. The central part of the counter body was made of 0.51 mm thick beryllium and served as the X-ray entrance window. The scintillator consisted of a 1.0 cm thick cylindrical shell of NaI(Tl) crystal surrounded on all sides by 0.3 cm thick plastic scintillator. The central region, 4.1 cm in diameter, was filled by a quartz light pipe. The whole assembly was enclosed (except for one end) in a 0.1 cm thick beryllium container. The energy channel resolution and timing resolution could be selected by commands sent to the spacecraft. The proportional counter could have up to 9 channels with 0.5 s resolution; the NaI scintillator could have up to 16 channels and 0.00025 s resolution. The gamma-ray burst mode was triggered by two simultaneous conditions: the count rates in certain PHA channels rose above a selected level and the spectral hardness of incident photons as determined by the ratio of 2 selected PHA channels exceeded a certain value.</div>

The detector was hermetically sealed in a Mg enclosure, which also provided the radiative surface for cooling. This structure reached a temperature of 130K roughly 3 days after launch and remained stable at that value for over a year. The detector system had a resolution of 10 keV at 570 keV and had 4096 energy channels.</div>
