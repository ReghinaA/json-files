<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he High Energy cosmic Radiation Detection facility (HERD)</b> is a module being built with a planned launch in 2027. It will be installed on China&rsquo;s Space Station as part of the Chinese Cosmic Lighthouse Program. It is intended to serve as a dark matter detector, a cosmic ray instrument, and observatory for high-energy gamma rays. The HERD detector will be launched separately from the space station and installed by a combination of robotic and space walk activities. Once installed, it would be a permanent part of the station, mounted with a zenithal pointing (upward away from the Earth) with an anticipated life span of ten years. The instrument can be upgraded or, if necessary, replaced during its lifespan.

<h3>Science Highlights</h3>

<p>The HERD mission intends to study extreme high-energy gamma rays, searching in particular for a &ldquo;gamma-ray smoking gun&rdquo; spectral signature anticipated from the annihilation signature of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a candidate dark matter particle candidate. It will also continue to study the steepening of the cosmic ray spectrum at or around 1 PeV, a known and unresolved issue in current cosmic-ray physics. It will also provide wide field-of-view guidance to narrow field ground-based instruments, particularly as the existing Fermi and Agile observatories are decommissioned during HERD&rsquo;s anticipated operations period. Finally, it would will make additional discoveries by opening a new window in extremely energetic gamma-rays beyond prior experiments.</p>
