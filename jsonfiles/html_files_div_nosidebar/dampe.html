<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE)</b> satellite, also known as &ldquo;Wukong&rdquo; (a reference to the Monkey King hero in the Chinese story &ldquo;Journey to the West&rdquo;), is a Chinese Academy of Science mission to measure highly energetic electrons and photons with high resolution in order to identify possible dark matter signatures.</p>
<p>The satellite was launched into a polar, sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 500 km on December 17, 2015. The Long March-2D rocket carrying DAMPE to orbit was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. At the start of operations, the mission was planned to have a three year service lifetime, but that was extended for a further two years in December 2018.</p>

      <div class="flex-fill">
          DAMPE observes the direction, charge, and energy of electrons and high-energy photons which would be generated when Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs, one of the candidate dark matter particles) annihilate: previous observations by other instruments have suggested this is a likely candidate for dark matter.

<h3>Payload</h3>
<p>DAMPE is a single instrument mission. The detector contains multiple elements, stacked vertically atop each other along the Z (observational direction) axis of the spacecraft</p>
