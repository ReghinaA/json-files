<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE)</b> satellite, also known as &ldquo;Wukong&rdquo; (a reference to the Monkey King hero in the Chinese story &ldquo;Journey to the West&rdquo;), is a Chinese Academy of Science mission to measure highly energetic electrons and photons with high resolution in order to identify possible dark matter signatures.</p>
<p>The satellite was launched into a polar, sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 500 km on December 17, 2015. The Long March-2D rocket carrying DAMPE to orbit was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. At the start of operations, the mission was planned to have a three year service lifetime, but that was extended for a further two years in December 2018.</p>

        DAMPE observes the direction, charge, and energy of electrons and high-energy photons which would be generated when Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs, one of the candidate dark matter particles) annihilate: previous observations by other instruments have suggested this is a likely candidate for dark matter.

<h3>Payload</h3>

<p>DAMPE is a single instrument mission. The detector contains multiple elements, stacked vertically atop each other along the Z (observational direction) axis of the spacecraft</p>

<tr><th rowspan="1">Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD)</th>
     <td colspan="2">The PSD consists of a double layer of 1 &times; 2.8 &times; 82 cm staggered strips laid out in alternating layers of X and Y orientation. with a 82 &times; 82 cm total area. The PSD detects the charge of cosmic rays and also serves as an anti-coincidence detector for energetic photons. It has a position resolution of 6 mm and charge resolution of 0.25 for Z = 1&ndash;20. It also serves as a backup to the STK element.</td>

  <tr><th rowspan="1">Silicon-Tungsten Tracker (STK)</th>
     <td colspan="2">The STK consists of multiple layers of silicon micro-strip detectors with interleaving tungsten converter plates. STK tracks the direction of gamma-rays by their conversion to charged particles in the tungsten plates, then tracking the particles through the instrument. STK has 6 tracking planes, each with two layers in X and Y planes, orthogonal to the instrument pointing. Cumulatively, this makes a sensor with 0.2&deg; angular resolution at 10 GeV and the total silicon area is roughly 7 m<sup>2</sup>.</td>

  <tr><th rowspan="1">Bismuth-Germanium Oxide (BGO)</th>
     <td colspan="2">The BGO calorimeter contains 308 bismuth germanate crystal bars, 2.5 &times; 2.5 &times; 60 cm, stacked in 14 layers in alternating X and Y direction orientations. A 0.5 mm gap around each crystal is filled with a silicone elastomer to hold each crystal in place and to prevent damage from launch vibrations. Incident particles interact with the crystals, generating a pulse of optical light which is detected by photomultipliers and each layer edge. The calorimeter is sensitive to energies between 5 GeV to 10 TeV.</td>
</tr>
  <tr><th rowspan="1">Neutral Detector (NUD)</th>
     <td colspan="2">The NUD consists of four large boron-doped plastic scintillation detectors, 30 &times; 30 &times; 1 cm in size. Each detector is equipped with a photomultiplier tube to measure light flashes causes by incident neutral particles exciting the boron and generating alpha particles and gamma-rays. The gamma-rays are converted to light pulses recorded by the instrument.</td>
