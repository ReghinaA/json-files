<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he Phobos 1</b> mission was launched on 7 July 1988 from Baykonur Cosmodrome. The primary objective of the mission, as with its sister probe Phobos 2, was to explore the larger of Mars&rsquo; two moons, Phobos. In addition to instrumentation to explore the Martian satellite, Phobos 1 also carried instruments to study the Sun, Mars, the interplanetary medium, and gamma-ray burst sources.</p>

<p>The Phobos 1 spacecraft was lost en-route to Mars after a faulty command sequence was sent from Earth caused the spacecraft to shut down. The shut down occurred on 2 September 1988.</p>

        Originally, both Phobos spacecraft were to carry identical instrument payloads. Mass limitations required some tradeoffs so that certain instruments were carried by only one spacecraft. Phobos 2 carried a total of 25 instruments. Of those, a few were high energy detectors.

<tr><td colspan="2">VGS translates as &ldquo;High Energy Burst Detector&rdquo;. The instrument focused on the medium to high energy range, complementing APEX (for high resolution spectra) and LILAS (low energy coverage). It was a Soviet collaboration between SNIIEM and IKI and used NaI(Tl) and CsI scintillation crystals with no collimator to obtain broad sky coverage.</td></tr>
