<p><b><font size="+2">T</font>he third US Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3)</b> was launched in May 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1&ndash;55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability.</p>

<h3>Payload</h3>

<p>There are four X-ray experiments on SAS-3 that all used proportional counters as detectors with different collimating system. The experiments were not co-aligned.</p>

<tr><td colspan="2">3 crossed slat collimators each with proportional counter. They were designed to monitor a large portion of the sky in a wide band of directions centered on the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the satellite (+Z). Each detector consisted of a proportional counter and collimator with an on-axis effective area of 75 cm<sup>2</sup>. The collimators define 3 long, narrow fields of view which intersect on the +Y axis and are inclined with respect to the YZ plane of the satellite at angles of -30°, 0°, and +30°, respectively. During scanning mode, an X-ray source would appear successively in the 3 detectors. Three lines of position could then be obtained, and their intersection determined the true source position. The center collimator had a field of view with FWHM 1&deg by 32&deg; and a FW of 2&deg; by 120&deg;. The left and right collimators had narrower, but similar responses, i.e., 0.5&deg; &times; 32&deg; (FWHM) and 1.0&deg; &times; 100&deg; (FW). The proportional counters were filled with argon and were sensitive in the range 5&ndash;15 keV. In addition the center detector had also a xenon counter, located behind the argon detector, that extend the response to 60 keV. Over the energy range 1.5&ndash;6 keV, 1 count/s = 1.5 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s for a Crab-like spectrum. In any given orbit, &sim;60% of the sky was scanned by the center slat detector with an exposure ranging from 300&ndash;1125 cm<sup>2</sup> sec.</td></tr>
